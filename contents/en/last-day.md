## Last day work at Ogilvy Vietnam

Today is last day I work at Ogilvy Vietnam, 2 month with many experience. Finally, I decide to find another job because I feel not suitable for this job, this environment.

At the company before I worked for, I have experience at the same team size, the same environment and the same working process. I think I have went through that moment If today I work permanent here I will repeat that. I think this team need more years to ground up.

I remember went I decide to end my 7 years work for Kyanon Digital. I thought, with about 30 years working in my life, I must to change company at lead one time. It is a good experience.

Ogilvy Vietnam have good working environment, good benefit, there are many good people in my team. Thanks everyone help me
