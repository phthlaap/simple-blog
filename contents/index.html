<h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I</h2>
<p>My name is Lap, I’m a web developer from Vietnam. After many year worked with Drupal, I thought that I just make website using Drupal, that is not develop website with right way, not programming right way with PHP and Drupal. So I decided to learn to contribute some Drupal modules to improve my coding, they are some simple modules but I feel happy when they follow Drupal standards and passed the security advisory coverage by Drupal community. I know I need to learn more, my knowledge is a drop in the ocean.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-want-to-write">Why I want to write</h2>
<p>After sometime I read document, practice, coding to build some contribute modules. I think I need to write down because this way is good for remember something, I want this blog is my note book.<br>
Please don’t feel uncomfortable because my English skill is too bad, If you see my spelling is wrong, please suggest me the correct word.</p>
